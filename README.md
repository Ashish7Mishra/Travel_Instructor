## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
*   JDK 8 or higher
*   Apache Tomcat 9 or higher
*   A Oracle SQL Database 
*   Apache Maven (for building the project)
*   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/travelInstructor.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd travelInstructor
    ```
3.  **Database Setup**
    *   Create a new database in your SQL server. For example, `travel_db`.
    *   Import the database schema if you have a `.sql` file, or run the SQL scripts to create the necessary tables.
    *   Update the database configuration in the Hibernate config file (`src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml`).
      ```xml
      <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/travel_db</property>
      <property name="hibernate.connection.username">your_db_username</property>
      <property name="hibernate.connection.password">your_db_password</property>
      ```

4.  **Build the Project**
    *   Use Maven to build the project. This will generate a `.war` file in the `target/` directory.
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

5.  **Deploy to Tomcat**
    *   Copy the generated `travelInstructor.war` file from the `target/` directory.
    *   Paste it into the `webapps/` directory of your Apache Tomcat installation.
    *   Start the Tomcat server.

6.  **Access the Application**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to:
      ```
      http://localhost:8080/travelInstructor
      ```
    *(The port and context path may vary depending on your server configuration.)*
